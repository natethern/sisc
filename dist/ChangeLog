	  symbols.  This caused import* and anonymous top-level modules
	  to fail.

	* Hooked circular printing code to error message code so that 
	  circular structures print properly (and don't stack overflow)
	  when generating error messages.

	  for R5RS compatibility.

2002-11-21  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Added missing serialization methods to some obscure data types -
	  there absence would have caused continuation serialization to
	  break in some unusual cases.

2002-11-19  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Fixed a bug in |write| and |display| when writing lists
	  containing unusual occurences of quote, quasiquote, unquote,

2002-09-29  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Made S2J's Java nulls typed, which, amongst other benefits,
	  allows them to be used for generic procedure method selection.

	* Removed S2J object mutation (java-new and java-set!). It's not
	  really that useful and it conflicts with typed Java nulls.

2002-09-28  Scott G. Miller  <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

2002-03-08  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Fixed access violation problems in generic functions when
	  sub-classes have more restrictive permissions than base
	  classes. The fix restricts the visiblity of non-public
	  classes/interfaces/methods.

	* Added mechanism to throw Java exceptions from Scheme code and
	  propagating them back to Java code if the Scheme code was called
	  from Java.

	  Chez Scheme.

2002-02-16  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Fixed two bugs in SNative's append.  First is that the last 
	  (in this case second) argument to append can be any object. Second

	  newly allocated.
	
2002-02-15  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Added new, experimental Scheme->Java interface module

	  a couple of bugs regarding module imports.

	* Immutables now implement equals/hashCode so like Immutables
	  can be serialized once.

2002-02-05  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Added support for legacy macros (defmacro and define-macro)

2002-02-04  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Added support for the common ASCII escape sequences (i.e. \n, \r
	  etc) when reading/writing strings.
	
	* Fixed bug in string comparison.
	
	* Fixed bug that gave wrong #f results in EQUAL? when comparing
	  mutable to immutable objects.
	
	* Fixed bug in PEEK-CHAR - \#nul was not being pushed back after
	  being read.

	* Added literal notation for case-sensitive symbols (|Foo|) and a
	  prim for toggling global case-sensitivity.

2002-01-30 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Changed Primitive's throw RuntimeExceptions to
          throwPrimExceptions.
 
	* Corrected error reporting of invalid indices to strings

2002-01-28 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Fixed circular structure creation for 'special' lists
	  created with ', `, ',', ,@, etc.

	* Added synopsis() to Value, which allows abbreviated printing.
	
2002-01-27  Matthias Radestock <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Added support for reading case sensitive symbols using the
	  |<symbol>| notation

2002-01-26 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Made Quantity lib implementations serialize and deserialize
	  the same.

2002-01-24 Released r1.3.1

2002-01-22 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Fixed a bug in Symbol serialization that affected
          improper deserialization of uninterned or case sensitive
          symbols (SGM)

2002-01-11 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* java/import can now take a String as the class/object
	  argument, which will be resolved into a class

2001-12-28  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Fixed locking thinko that broke the mutex goal :(

	* Added monitor/synchronize-unsafe, which does *not* use
	  dynamic-wind but runs an order of magnitude faster

	* Made monitor/synchronize[-unsafe] take one or more
	  expressions to synchronize rather than just one.

2001-12-24  Release 1.3.0

2001-12-16  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

	* Implemented Scheme level threading and synchronzation

	* Fixed a division by zero error in the refined Quantity classes

2001-12-14  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Implemented clean interface for calling Scheme from Java,
	including support for multiple applications and multiple threads

	* Fixed and optimized several multi-threading issues

2001-12-13  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Removed current-writer, was only used by repl which now just
	calls pretty-print directly

2001-12-04  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

	* Made literal strings, vectors and lists immutable

2001-12-04  Scott G. Miller  <scgmille@freenetproject.org>
	
	* Fixed string->number, which should have been able to accept
	  #[xobd]num format numbers as well as ordinary ones.

	* Fixed string->number handling of ""

	* Fixed sqrt on negative floating point values

        * Fixed error in lexer's handling of EOF.

	* Removed String constructor for Quantities, rely
	  on valueOf, which requires much less needless instantiation.

	* Fixed precision loss during serialization/deserialization

	* Fixed handling of uncertain digits in exact numbers.

        * Added Thread support (preliminary)
  
        * Fixed equals? handling of immutable data (more specifically,
          equals? handling of subclasses of values)

12/1/2001 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>	

	* Removed BeginExp, DefineExp, FreeSetExp, IfExp, and LexicalSetExp,
          which were replaced with EvalExp, which simply evaluates
          an expression and pushes another onto the stack (the second being
          the corresponding Eval)

r1.2.3  Performance enhancements

        * Added ashr, the complement to ashl.  
 
	* In fixing other reader errors, 1.2.2 fixed hex digit handling.
	  Fixed.

	* exact? and inexact? should error on non-numbers.  They 
	  weren't.  Fixed.

	* eqv? in scheme was relying on above bug for correct operation.

r1.2.2  Minor enhancements, bug fixes

	* Output ports do not automatically flush now (except for
	  console out).  

	* Added 'flush-output-port' which takes an output port
 	  and finalizes any writes

	* Added an optional parameter to open-output-file and
	  get-socket-output-port, <autoflush>, a boolean.  If
	  #t, the port will flush after every write.

	* #\return wasn't recognized on read, but could be produced
          on write.  Fixed.

	* (null-environment) was returning a completely empty 
	  environment, which is incorrect in SISC, since the special
	  forms (quote, lambda, etc) should still be present.  Fixed.

	* Fixed an inaccuracy in the reader, where "<radix> <exactness>
          could not be used.

 	* Somewhat fixed the parser wrt the unspecified digit, '#'.
	  Still somewhat broken in that the presence of a '#' does not
          force inexactness.

r1.2.1  Bugfixes

	* Ratio simplification now properly handles numerator
	  and denominator signs sanely.  

	* Full-sisc now includes J2S, Netlib, Exec, and Debug
	
r1.2.0  Major enhancements

	* New serialization structure.  The heap can be serialized in 1/3
          the space, and we can shave .7 seconds off SISC startup time.
          Also, the heap isn't tied to a specific version of SISC.
	  (Not present in sisc-lite)
	
	* Dead code eliminated

	* Default Quantity lib is now double precision floating point 
	  instead of arbitrary precision.  In the future, the library
          will be selectable at startup

	* Some minor performance tweaks 

r1.1.3  Bug fixes (Never formally released)

	* Added continuation? type checker

	* Fixed scalability issue in Pair.display.  Couldn't handle
	  incredibly large lists because it was using a recursive
	  print method (which doesnt work well in Java, stack smash)
	
r1.1.2  Bug fixes

	* Fixed startup scripts for windows

	* Cross-platform path handling (only tested on Windows/Unix atm)

	* Tidied up SLIB initialization file

	* Limiting lexical depth to 65536, function argument count to
          65536
	
r1.1.1  Bug fixes, code cleaning

	* Startup scripts werent able to load files, fixed 
	
	* Error in the syntax expander wasnt handling final cdr
          unquotes in a quasi-quoted list
  
	* Vector printing optimizations

	* Scheme source optimized and tidied to hide scaffolding functions

r1.1.0  Many many changes.  v1.1.0 is on average 45% faster than 1.0.3

	Reimplementation of global environments as a simple flat array.

        * LexicalEnvironments don't need symbol information,
          this was an old debugging mode that isn't necessary.
          Result is a smaller heap and small boost to 
          performance.
        
        Added Matthias Radestock's optimizations:
        * replace recursion with loops in LexicalEnvironment.lookup and
	  LexicalEnvironment.set => no noticable difference, but might 
          show in deeply nested expressions

	* recycler for FillRibExp along the same lines as CallFrames. 
	  This gives a 5-10% performance boost.

	* creation of {*}Eval instances in constructor of
	  {FreeSet,If,LexicalSet}Expr, rather than in eval method. 
	  Shifts the burden from runtime to compile time and results in 
	  ~5% performance boost.

        Added Immediates, which fill the value rib directly (16% bonus)

        Compiler now eliminates Immediates from effect context.  Example:
	   (begin (set! a 3) 5 a) => (begin (set! a 3) a)
           (begin 1 a (lambda (x) x) #t) => #t
        and chooses branches with a decidable constant test-exp:
           (if 3 1 2) => 1
           (if #f 1 2) => 2
        
        Made SISC thread safe.  Also added two new methods in Interpreter:

        * newContext(Interpreter):  Creates a new Interpreter context
          in which expressions can be interpreted.  By having multiple
          Interpreter contexts, you can run multiple scheme programs in the
          same environment simultaneously (multithreaded scheme).  
  
        * eval(String): Evaluates the given String as a scheme expression in 
          the current context and returns the resulting value.  This should
          be helpful for running scheme expressions from Java.

        Fixed a Ratio->Floating point conversion error in Quantity.

        Fixed R5RS env handling.  There were a number of side cases
        where the R5RS env was not immutable, or where shadowing the R5RS
        environment wasn't reflected in procedures defined before that 
        shadowed binding.

        Fixed abs for complex numbers.
        Made procedures proper values.

        TODO: Add synchronization module to allow synchronization in scheme
              code.

r1.0.3  Cruft bug that disabled number->string
        Precision fixes so FP calculations respect max_precision
        Added setters/getters for max-precision and min-precision.  These
          can be used to set the minimum and maximum amount of precision
          allowed in a floating point calculation
        Some minor code cleanup
        Some minor speed improvements (very minor)
r1.0.2  Added Boxes back into the language since they were used in 
  	  variable references.
r1.0.1	Fixed continuation capturing bug related to side-effects on the
  	  value rib.
r1.0.0	First public release.
