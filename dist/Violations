This file lists all known violations of the R5RS Scheme Standard by SISC:

Letter of the standard Violations:

Section               Description

5.3		      SISC's syntax expander does not report an error
	 	      when a new binding shadows a syntactic keyword.
		      e.g., (define define 3) does not produce an error.		      
6.4		      SISC's dynamic wind implementation does not
		      currently work with SISC's exception handling 
		      model.  This is considered a high priority violation.

		      
Spirit of the standard Violations:

2.3		      SISC allows identifiers to start with +, -, or .,
		      if they cannot be read as numbers.
2.3		      SISC uses the reserved characters '[' and ']'
		      as synonyms for '(' and ')' respectively
2.3		      SISC does not raise any warning or error
	              when encountering the reserved characters "[]{}|", 
                      and allows "{}|" to appear in identifiers.
4.1.3		      SISC does not distinguish between () and the quoted
	              empty list '(). 
6.2.3		      The standard recommends that operations such
		      as sqrt should try to provide exact results
		      when given exact arguments.  SISC's do not
		      currently.
6.2.6		      SISC allows radixes other than those specified
 		      in the contract for number->string, and 
                      string->number.  In particular, any radix up to
	              36 is allowed, and any unsupported value causes
		      SISC to revert to base 10.
