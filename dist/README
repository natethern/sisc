About SISC (Second Interpreter of Scheme Code)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SISC is a relatively lightweight, from scratch, fully functional Scheme
interpreter.  SISC is the successor to LISC, and sacrifices a few dozen
more KB in order to be orders of magnitude faster and fully R5RS compliant.
SISC has the following general features:

    * Fully R5RS compliant.    
    * A full number tower for unlimited precision math including:
         - Arbitrary precision integers, floating point numbers 
         - Arbitrary precision ratios (based on bigints)
         - Arbitrary precision complex numbers (based on bigfloats)
    * A fully R5RS compliant, hygienic macro system based on syntax-case.
    * Full support for continuations via call/cc.

Installation
------------
  Define SISC_HOME in your environment variables to point the directory 
in which you wish to store the "sisc.shp" and the various ".jar" files.
Then, install "sisc" or "sisc.bat" in your path.  If you are running on a 
Unix or Unix-like system, you may also wish to install the various 
shell scripts in scheme-src/srfi-22 in your path in order to support the
SRFI-22 functionality of Scheme programs as Unix scripts.
  To run SISC, just type "sisc" or "sisc.bat", followed by any scheme 
source files you wish to load.

More information about SISC, including a paper on the implementation
and the full SISC manual, can be found at the SISC website,
