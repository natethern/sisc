About SISC (Second Interpreter of Scheme Code)
----------------------------------------------

SISC is an extensible Java based interpreter of the algorithmic
language Scheme.  SISC uses modern interpretation techniques, and
handily outperforms all existing JVM interpreters (often by more than
an order of magnitude).

In addition, SISC is a complete implementation of the language. The
entire R5RS Scheme standard is supported, no exceptions. This includes
a full number tower including complex number support, arbitrary
precision integers and floating point numbers, as well as hygenic R5RS
macros, proper tail recursion, and first-class continuations (not just
the escaping continuations as in many limited Scheme systems). SISC
also attempts to implement the standard as correctly as possible,
while still providing exceptional performance.

SISC also provides useful real-world extensions, such as networking,
elegant exception handling, a scope-friendly module system, support
for SLIB, numerous SRFIs, and a Java foreign-function interface.

Finally, native functionality can be added through the use of Modules,
extensions that may add new types, values, and functions to the
language. These extensions can be packaged into scopable modules at
the Scheme level as well.

Installation
------------

Define SISC_HOME in your environment variables to point to the
directory in which you installed the SISC distribution. Then, install
"sisc.sh" or "sisc.bat" in your path. If you are running on a Unix or
Unix-like system, you may also wish to install the various shell
scripts in scheme-src/srfi-22 in your path in order to support the
SRFI-22 functionality of Scheme programs as Unix scripts.  To run
SISC, just type "sisc" or "sisc.bat", followed by any scheme source
files you wish to load.

More information about SISC, including a paper on the implementation
and the full SISC manual, can be found at the SISC website,
