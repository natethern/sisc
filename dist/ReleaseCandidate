This build of SISC is a Release Candidate, as such, it may contain
bugs.  Also, it has been built with debugging symbols in the heap, which
is why it is larger than ordinary builds.  If you encounter an unexpected
error, please send an email to sisc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, with the
following information:

1. Build version
2. Steps to reproduce the error
3. A stack trace, 
  (stack-trace (get-last-exception))

If you're running the Lite build, you will not be able to perform step 3. 
Please obtain the full build and see if your error occurs there as well,
then submit a report with the stack trace from the full build.  

Thanks!
