SchemeAppServlet has the following init parameters
* app-name
* heap-file
* init-expr
* destroy-expr (optional)
SchemeAppServlet is responsible for initialising a scheme
application. When it's init() method is called it establishes an
application context of the given name and loads the specified heap
into it. The heap-file is loaded from a location relative to the
servlet context root.

Typically there would be *one* SchemeAppServlet per web app and it
would be loaded when the web app starts up. There is nothing stopping
you though from having several Scheme applications within a single web
app.

The servlet responds to a GET request by returning a form. It responds
to POST requests containing an "expressions" param by evaluating the
contents of the "expressions" post param in the scheme applications
top-level env and returning the resulting output. If, however, the
Content-Type of the POST is "application/x-scheme", then the servlet
will try to read the incoming data stream as an s-expression, evaluate
it within the scheme app and stream back the result.

init-expr is evaluated after init() has loaded the heap. The
evaluation must yield a function. init() then calls that function with
the servlet object as a parameter. Ditto for destroy-expr, which gets
evaluated and the resulting function called when the servlet's
destroy() method is called.

The current directory which is active during the evaluation of
init-expr and destroy-expr is the servlet context root, which means
relative file names in load etc are resolved relative to it.

The SchemeAppServlet checks for servlet context init parameters called
"<app-name>-repl-port" and "<app-name>-repl-host". If the former is
present the servlet creates a thread listening for connections on that
port. New connections spawn a thread with a Read-Eval-Print-Loop
running in the servlet's Scheme application, i.e. connecting to the
port via, say, telnet will present you with a SISC prompt just as if
you were running SISC from the command line except that all
expressions are evaluated within the context of the servlet's Scheme
application.

Specifying repl-host forces the the listening port to be bound to a
specific IP address.


SchemeServlet has the following init parameters:
* app-name
* init-expr
* destroy-expr (optional)

init-expr and destroy-expr behave as described above.

The servlet object has public slots deleteFn, getFn, putFn, postFn,
which are intially all set to null, indicating that the default
HttpServlet methods should be called. If a slot is non-null, it is
assumed to be a Scheme function that takes two arguments. The function
is invoked with the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse
objects. The return value is ignored.
