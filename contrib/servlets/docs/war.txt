Building, Deploying and Managing Web Applications with SISC
===========================================================

Structure of a SISC web application
===================================
SISC web applications are standard J2EE web applications that, like
all J2EE applications, can be deployed "flat" or packaged as a war
file.

One SISC web application can contain multiple Scheme
applications. Each Scheme application consists of an application
servlet and one or more Scheme servlets. The application servlet is an
instance of sisc.contrib.servlets.SchemeAppServlet that is normally
loaded on start up of the enclosing web application. This is
accomplished by a suitable load-on-startup declaration in web.xml. The
application servlet initialises the SISC web application by loading a,
typically generic, SISC heap file followed by executing
application-specific initialisation code.

Scheme servlets are the interface for all user interactions with a
SISC web application. They are instances of the class
sisc.contrib.servlets.SchemeServlet that are associated with specific
Scheme applications via an application name initialization parameter
that is identical to one used by an application servlet. Note that the
combination of web application display name (as configured in web.xml)
and Scheme application name must be unique across all web applications
deployed in the same web application server.

The reasons for separating application servlets from Scheme servlets,
rather than just having one servlet per Scheme application, are:

- SISC web applications can take advantage of standard J2EE url
mapping for selecting different execution paths and access controls
for incoming requests.

- fine degree of control via web application management consoles that
are shipped with many J2EE web application servers.

- clear separation of application initialisation and management from
main application functionality


Initialisation
==============
The Scheme application servlet loads the SISC heap file specified in
the heap-file initialisation parameter in web.xml. The file name is
resolved relative to the servlet context root. Thus, typically a SISC
web application would contain the heap file(s) in the WEB-INF
directory.

After the heap file has been loaded, the Scheme application servlet
evaluates the Scheme expression(s) supplied via the init-expr
initialisation parameter. The expression must yield a one-argument
procedure which is then invoked with the Scheme application servlet as
the parameter.

The code in init-expr typically does one of the following

- nothing - if all application code is part of the heap file

- load file(s) with LOAD - all file loading is performed relative the
servlet context root.

- load libraries with REQUIRE-LIBRARY - prior to that the library-path
configuration parameter would typically be modified to include a
directory relative to the servlet context root, e.g.
  (library-path-prepend (normalize-url (current-directory)
                                       "scheme-lib/"))


Access control
==============
guard access to application servlets and scheme servlets with standard
J2EE access control.
