Description: SISC is a Java integrated, fully R5RS compliant Scheme system.
 SISC is an extensible Java based interpreter of the algorithmic language Scheme. 
 SISC uses modern interpretation techniques, and handily outperforms all existing 
 JVM interpreters (often by more than an order of magnitude).
 .
 In addition, SISC is a complete implementation of the language. The entire 
 R5RS Scheme standard is supported, no exceptions. This includes a full number 
 tower including complex number support, arbitrary precision integers and floating 
 point numbers, as well as hygenic R5RS macros, proper tail recursion, and first-class 
 continuations (not just the escaping continuations as in many limited Scheme systems). 
 SISC also attempts to implement the standard as correctly as possible, while 
 still providing exceptional performance.
 .
 SISC also provides useful real-world extensions, such as networking, elegant exception 
 handling, a scope-friendly module system, support for SLIB, numerous SRFIs, and a Java 
 foreign-function interface.
 .
 Finally, native functionality can be added through the use of Modules, extensions that
 may add new types, values, and functions to the language. These extensions can be 
 packaged into scopable modules at the Scheme level as well.
