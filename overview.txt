SISC's Third Generation IO system

Over the past few releases, we've been aware of shortcomings in the generic I/O layer
of SISC, namely complexity and performance.  This proposal (implemented in a branch)
seeks to address these shortcomings by simplifying the I/O layer in general, removing
genericity, and adding extensibility through functor based ports.

(time (let ((start (system-time))
            (out (open-output-file "/dev/null")))
        (let loop ((x 0))
          (if (< (system-time) (+ start 1000))
            (begin (write-char #\0 out) (loop (+ x 1)))
            x))))

(import binary-io)
(time (let ((start (system-time))
            (in (open-binary-input-file "/dev/zero"))
            (buffer (make-buffer 4096)))
        (let loop ((x 0))
          (if (< (system-time) (+ start 1000))
              (loop (+ x (read-block buffer 0 4096 in ))) x))))
