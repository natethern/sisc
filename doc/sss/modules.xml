      The Module System
    </title>
    <para>
      The Module system consists of two components. The first is the
      module syntax extension provided by R. Kent Dybvig's syntax
      expander &lsqb;REF&rsqb;. This level provides the ability to
      scope Scheme code into importable modules with selectable
      exports. 
    </para>
    <para>
      The second is the Java level &SISC; API for
      native extensions to the language. A &SISC;
      module defines new types and functions. Each
      &SISC; module can be queried from Scheme, and
      imported into the runtime environment as a whole, or packaged
      via the same export mechanism as native Scheme code.
