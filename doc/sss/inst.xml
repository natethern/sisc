      &SISC; primarily targets the Java Virtual
      Machine, and the Java v1.2 and higher class libraries.  The
      1.2 libraries and VM are required due to a reliance on memory
      reference functionality used to properly garbage collect
      unused symbols while still maintaining pointer equality between
      those that remain active.
    </para>
    <para>
      &SISC; does not require any particular operating system, though
      the official distribution currently provides launching
      assistance for Windows and Unix based systems.  Theoretically
      any machine that supports Java 1.2 or higher should be able to
      run &SISC;.

      The Read-Eval-Print-Loop
    </title>
    <para>
      As in most Scheme systems, &SISC;'s primary
      human interface is a REPL, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop.  &SISC;
      presents the user with a prompt ('>'), then reads an
      s-expression from the console.  &SISC; then evaluates the
      s-expression, producing a value or error, which it then
      prints.  Finally the process begins again with a new prompt.
    </para>
    <para>
      The process terminates with a forced kill of the JVM (with
      Control-C or similar), or when an end of file is detected on
      the console.  Also, the <function>exit</function> procedure may
      be used to exit the current REPL.

    <para>
      Executing or loading code in the REPL ordinarily produces a value
      result which is displayed during the Print phase.  However,
      two other message types may be displayed.  First, if an error
      is raised that is not handled by the running program, the
      message will be described in one of several forms, depending on what
      combinations of a location, a message, and a parent message the
      error has:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Error.

Error in &lt;error-location&gt;.

Error: &lt;description&gt;
      
Error in &lt;error-location&gt;: &lt;description&gt;
      
Error in nested call.
&lt;nested-error&gt;

Error in nested call: &lt;description&gt;
&lt;nested-error&gt;

Error in nested call from &lt;error-location&gt;.
&lt;nested-error&gt;

Error in nested call from &lt;error-location&gt;: &lt;description&gt;
&lt;nested-error&gt;
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      The location of an error often refers to the name of a procedure,
      syntax, or parameter.  Errors that do not contain a location often
      originate in an anonymous function.  Nested errors occur when
      one function makes a call to another function and the second raises an
      error.  If the first function wishes, it may catch this error and
      generate its own, with the second functions error as a parent.  Thus
      a nested error consists of an error message on the first line,
      and the nested error message or messages on following lines.
    </para>
    <para>
      In addition to errors, it is possible for code to produce
      warnings during compilation or run-time.  A warning is a
      message to the user about a condition that is unusual but not
      terminal to the program flow.  The compiler, for example, does
      a minimal amount of sanity checking on code and may produce
      warnings about code that has the potential to raise errors
      during execution.  Warnings are always distinguished from
      ordinary messages by surrounding braces ({}) and starting
      with the word 'warning'.

    <title>Running &SISC;</title>
    <para>
      &SISC;'s official distribution provides a startup script for
      Windows and Unix based hosts.  Simply executing this script
      starts the &SISC; REPL.  Zero or more Scheme source files can
      also be specified on the command line after the script name,
      which will be loaded in order before the REPL prompt is
      displayed.

      It may be desirable to pass options to the underlying JVM.  This
      can be done by setting the <literal>JAVAOPT</literal>
      environment variable to the options you wish to pass to the
      JVM.  This includes switches for heap size, system properties,
      etc.  &SISC; itself has a number of properties that can affect
      its operation.  See <xref linkend="system-properties"/> 
      for a list of these properties and their meanings.

    <title>Common File Extensions</title>

      &SISC; supports a number of file types for loading Scheme code
      into the interpreter.  The common extensions are:

        <para>
          <literal>sce</literal> - Scheme code expanded.  This type of
          code has been processed by the syntax expander and contains
          only core Scheme forms.

      <listitem>
        <para>

        <para>
          <literal>shp</literal> - (Pronounced sheep) &SISC; heap file.
