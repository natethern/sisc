Generic Procedures
==================

Generic procedures are procedures that select & execute methods based
on the types of the arguments to the generic procedure
invocation. Methods have a type signature, which generic procedures
use for method selection, and contain a procedure which is invoked by
generic procedures when the method has been selected for execution.


Methods
-------

Methods are records of type <method>.


MAKE-METHOD <procedure> <list types> <rest?> => <method>
Creates a new method containing procedure <procedure> whose type
signature is <types>. If <rest?> is #t then the procedure can take
rest arguments.

Generic procedures always invoke methods with a special "next:"
argument as the first parameter, followed by all the arguments of the
generic procedure invocation. For more details on the next: parameter
see below.


METHOD? <value> => #t/#f
Determines whether <value> is a method.


METHOD-PROCEDURE <method> => <procedure>
Returns the procedure associated with <method>


METHOD-TYPES <method> => <list types>
Returns the type signature of <method>


METHOD-REST? <method> => #t/#f
Determines whether <method> has a rest parameter.


METHOD-ARITY <method> => <number>
Determines the number of mandatory arguments to the method. Note that
the special "next:" argument is not counted in this.


METHOD= <method1> <method2> => #t/#f
Determines whether two methods have identical signatures, i.e. have
equal types (as determined by the TYPES= procedure) and rest parameter
flag.


METHOD-APPLICABLE? <method> <list types> => #t/#f
Determines whether <method> is applicable to arguments of types
<types>. For this procedure to return #t the following conditions must
be met:

* If the method accepts rest arguments then <types> must contain
at least as many elements as the <method>'s type signature.

* If the method does not accepts rest arguments then <types> must
contain exactly as many elements as the <method>'s type signature.

* All the types in the method's <type> signature must be supertypes of
the corresponding types in <types>. This comparison is performed using
the TYPES<= procedure.


COMPARE-METHODS <method1> <method2> <list types>
=> equal, ambiguous, more-specific, less-specific
Determines the relationship of two methods by comparing their type
signatures against each other and using the supplied <types> for
disambiguation. <types> must be applicable (as determined by
METHOD-APPLICABLE?) to both <method1> and <method2>.

The result of the overall comparison is initialised to 'equal. Then a
triple-wise comparison is performed on successive elements of the type
method signatures and <types>, using the COMPARE-TYPES procedure:

* If we run out of elements in both method signatures we return
the result computed so far.

* If we run out of elements in <method1>'s signature only then we
return 'less-specific.

* If we run out of elements in <method2>'s signature only then we
return 'more-specific.

* If COMPARE-TYPES returns 'equal we proceed to the next triple.

* If COMPARE-TYPES returns 'ambiguous we set the result to 'ambiguous
and proceed to the next triple.

* If COMPARE-TYPES returns 'less-specific we return 'less-specific.

* If COMPARE-TYPES returns 'more-specific we return 'more-specific.

Informally, the above performs a left-to-right match, returning the
result of the type comparison at the point of the first discernible
difference.


METHOD ([(next: ?next)] (<type> ?arg) ... [. ?rest]) . ?body
=> <method>
Creates a method. This syntactic form is similar to the LAMBDA form,
except that all parameters must be typed and that an optional leading
special "next:" parameter can be present.


Procedures
----------

Generic procedures are invoked like ordinary procedures. They contain
a list of methods from which the method that is most applicable to the
arguments is selected and invoked.


MAKE-GENERIC-PROCEDURE [<generic-proc> ...] => <generic-proc>
Creates a generic procedure. If <generic-proc>s are specified then
their method lists are combined, in effect merging the generic
procedures into one.


GENERIC-PROCEDURE-METHODS <generic-proc> => <list methods>
Returns the list of methods currently contained in <generic-proc>.


ADD-METHOD <generic-proc> <method>
Adds <method> to <generic-proc>. Any existing method with the same
signature as <method> is removed.

Method addition is thread-safe.


ADD-METHODS <generic-proc> <list methods>
Adds <methods> to <generic-proc>. This is more efficient than calling
ADD-METHOD on each individual method.


APPLICABLE-METHODS <generic-proc> <list types>
=> <applicable> <ambiguous>
Returns all methods of <generic-proc> that are applicable, as
determined by METHOD-APPLICABLE?, to <types>. The result is returned
as two lists which result from pair-wise method comparison using
COMPARE-METHODS.

The first list contains a all the applicable methods, ordered
by their specificity, for which an unambiguous ordering could be
determined. The second list contains all those applicable methods for
which no unambiguous ordering by specificity was possible.


Syntax
------

DEFINE-GENERIC ?name [<generic-proc> ...]
Creates a binding for ?name to a new generic procedure.

This form is equivalent to
  DEFINE ?name (MAKE-GENERIC-PROCEDURE <generic-proc> ...)


DEFINE-GENERICS [?name | (?name <generic-proc> ...)] ...
Creates bindings for several new generic procedures.

This form expands into several DEFINE-GENERIC forms.


DEFINE-METHOD (<generic-proc> . ?signature) . ?body
Creates a method and adds it to <generic-proc>.

This form is equivalent to
  ADD-METHOD <generic-proc> (METHOD ?signature . ?body)


DEFINE-METHODS <generic-proc> (?signature . ?body) ...
Creates several methods and adds them to <generic-proc>.

This form is equivalent to
  ADD-METHODS <generic-proc> (LIST (METHOD ?signature . ?body) ...)


"next:" method parameter
------------------------
The METHOD form and derived forms (e.g. DEFINE-METHOD and
DEFINE-METHODS), permit the specification of a special first parameter
to the method invocation. When a generic procedure invokes a method,
this parameter is bound to a procedure that when called will invoke
the "next best matching" method. This is the next method in the list
of applicable methods returned by APPLICABLE-METHODS when it was
called by the generic procedure upon invocation.

If no "next best matching" method exists, i.e. the current method is
the last in the list, then the next parameter is #f. This allows
methods to invoke the next best matching method selectively depending
on whether it is present. This is an important feature since the
dynamic nature of method selection makes it impossible to determine
at the time of writing the method whether there is going to be a next
best matching method.

The next best matching method must be invoked with arguments to which
the current method is applicable.


What's Changed?
---------------

The major changes in the generic procedure system since the previous
version are as follows:

* The code and module have been disentangled from that of the type
system, object system and Java FFI.

* There is a clear internal separation between code that deals with
methods and code that deals with generic procedures.

* The new extensible type system is used for all type-related
operations.

* There is a new METHOD form for creating methods. It's main purpose
is to simplify the construction of derived syntax.

* Methods now have a distinct type, <method>.

* The new ADD-METHOD procedure facilitates the adding of multiple
methods to a generic procedure. This is more efficient than using
individual calls to ADD-METHOD.

* The new DEFINE-GENERICS form provides a concise syntax for the
creation of bindings to multiple new generic procedures.

* Generic procedures can be merged. This is useful in situations where
several independently developed modules define generic procedures for
identical purposes and an application needs to use and extend both.

* Generic procedures can no longer be chained. Chaining makes it
impossible to meaningfully and safely use the "next best matching
method" invocation facility of generic procedures since it results in
methods being incapable of discerning whether there *is* a next best
matching method.

* Improved error reporting.
