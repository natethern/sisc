Object System
=============

The key features of the object system are:

* class-based, with a restricted form of multiple inheritance

* instance variables (slots) are accessed and modified via generic
  procedures

* no methods - generic procedures are used instead

* introspection API

* full integration into SISC's extensible type system


Classes
-------

Classes have a name, a list of direct superclasses, and a list of
direct slots ("instance variable") definitions.


MAKE-CLASS <name> <list class> <list slot-defs> => <class>
Creates a class named <name> with the specified list of <class>es as
its superclasses. See Inheritance for restrictions on
superclasses. When no superclasses are specified, the superclass is
<object>.

The list of <slot-def>s is an association list with each entry of the
form
(<slot-name> (<slot-prop-name> . <slot-prop-value) ...)

<slot-name> names a slot. <slot-prop-name> must be the name of one of
the define slot properties, and <slot-prop-value> is its value. The
following are the valid slot properties:

value - the initial value of the slot

accessor - a generic procedure to which an accessor method for the
slot will be added by MAKE-CLASS.

modifier - a generic procedure to which a modifier method for the slot
will be added by MAKE-CLASS.

See Inheritance for the semantics of slot inheritance.

All classes are instances of the type <class>.

Classes are types in the type system.


DEFINE-CLASS (<class-name> <superclass> ...)
  (<slot-name> (<slot-prop-name> <slot-prop-value>) ...)
  ...
=> <class>
Binds <class-name> to a newly created class. This form
expands into a call to the MAKE-CLASS procedure.


CLASS? <value> => #t/#f
Determines whether <value> is a class.


CLASS-NAME <class> => <symbol>
Returns the name of <class>.


CLASS-DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES <class> => (list <class>)
Returns the direct superclasses of <class>.


CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS <class> => (list <slot>)
Returns the direct slots defined for <class>.


CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST <class> => (list <class>)
Returns the total order of <class> and all direct & indirect
superclasses, as determined by the partial orders obtained from
calling CLASS-DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES.

The ordering of classes in the class precedence list is important when
comparing types using the type system's COMPARE-TYPES procedure, which
is used by the generic procedure method selection algorithm. See
COMPARE-METHODS.


Slots
-----

All slots are instances of the type <slot>.


SLOT? <value> => #t/#f
Determines whether <value> is a slot.


SLOT-NAME <slot> => <symbol>
Returns the name of <slot>.


SLOT-CLASS <slot> => <class>
Returns the class on which <slot> is defined.


SLOT-INITIALIZER <slot> => <procedure>
Returns a procedure than when applied to an instance of <slot>'s
class, will set the slot's value on that instance to its initial
value.


SLOT-ACCESSOR <slot> => <procedure>
Returns a procedure that when applied to an instance of <slot>'s
class, will return the slot's value on that instance.


SLOT-MODIFIER <slot> => <procedure>
Returns a procedure that when applied to an instance of <slot>'s
class, with one further argument, sets the slot's value on that
instance to the value supplied as the second argument of the call.


SLOT-INITIALIZER-METHOD <slot> => <method>
SLOT-ACCESSOR-METHOD <slot> => <method>
SLOT-MODIFIER-METHOD <slot> => <method>
These are method-returning versions of the corresponding SLOT-*
procedures. The methods are suitable for adding to generic
procedures.


Instantiation
-------------

MAKE <class> <value> ... => <instance>
Instantiates <class>.

Instantiation creates a new object that is an instance of <class> and
initialises its slots using the slots' initialisers. The instance and
<value>'s are then passed as parameters to a call to the INITIALIZE
generic procedure.

INITIALIZE serves the same purpose as constructors in other object
systems. By default, INITIALIZE contains a no-op method for
initialising objects of type <object> with no further arguments. Since
all objects are instances of <object> this means that all classes can
be instantiated by calling (make <class>).


Inheritance
-----------

The object system supports a restricted form of multiple
inheritance. When multiple superclasses are specified in
MAKE-CLASS/DEFINE-CLASS, the resulting new class is a sub-type of all
of them. However, for any two classes in the class precedence list of
the new class the following restriction applies:

If both classes have direct slots then one must be a subclass of
the other.

In effect this enforces single inheritance of slots while still giving
control over the order of classes in the class-precedence list.

Slots from a superclass are only ever inherited once, regardless of
the number of paths in the inheritance graph to that class.

If a subclass defines a slot with the same name as one of its
superclasses, the resulting class ends up with *two* slots of the same
name. If the slots are define with different accessors and modifiers
then this does not cause any problems at all. If they are not then an
invocation of the accessor/modifier will acess/modify the slot of the
subclass. Note that it is still possible to access/modify the slot of
the superclass by using procedures/methods obtained from the
SLOT-{ACCESSOR,MODIFIER}-{PROCEDURE,METHOD} applied to the slot.


What's Changed?
---------------

* The code and module have been disentangled from that of generic
procedures, the type system and Java FFI.

* Objects are no longer procedures. Slots are accessed and modified
via generic procedures.

* Classes are no longer objects; they are records of type <class>.

* Classes are types that are hooked into new extensible type system.

* Slots are a distinct data type (records of type <slot>), resulting
in a more structured reflection API.

* Slots can be initialized by a procedure.

* Multiple inheritance of slots is not permitted.

* Slots of sub-classes with the same name of slots in a super-classes
shadow the the latter rather than replacing them.

* Objects have a much more compact internal representation than
before.

* Class instantiation has been simplified; there no longer is a CREATE
generic procedure for pre-instantiation processing.

* Improved error reporting.
