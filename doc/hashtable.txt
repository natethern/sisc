Hashtables
==========
Hashtables are implemented by the module "hashtable", which exports
the following functions:

make-hashtable
hashtable? v

Hashtables can be evaluated, passing one arg or two args in order to
do a get or put respectivly.

hashtable/put! hashtable key obj [not-present]
hashtable/get hashtable key [not-present]
hashtable/remove! hashtable key [not-present]

<not-present> gets returned when the the hashtable did not contain the
key prior to execution of the operation. It defaults to #f.

hashtable/clear! hashtable
hashtable->alist hashtable
alist->hashtable alist
hashtable/keys hashtable

hashtable/for-each proc hashtable
hashtable/map proc hashtable

<proc> is invoked with two parameters containing the key and value
respectively. The current implementation is not particularly efficient
since it converts the hashtable to an alist first.
